### Contact tracking workflow

# First goal:  compare populations of partners named through two ways:
#             A. HIV-infected index individuals
#             B. HIV-uninfected index individuals

# Randomly select N group A and N group B individuals
#   all these individuals should be selected from a bounded time window (1 year?)
#
